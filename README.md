My store starts out with a tragic over egger oblivious first-time users... 

I don't really know much about GitHub, I can merge, comment create pull request some times, But I want to learn a lot more. I originally started just by driving  
in. Downloading this and that, pulling this I should not have pull, just head first blind as a bat. This got me into some trouble someone how through my  privacy settings I am guessing, someone was able to access a few of my wallets and whipped me clean. They were nice enough after stealing thousands of dollars from me, To leave me a note ”tighten your privacy settings”. Well, lessoned learned, I am paying attention this time. For a while there I just plan stayed away from github,but then finally coming to the conclusion there's gotta be a way. So, I am back to learn from my mistakes and faults and try to really grasp an understanding of GitHub. 

The GitHub world is way over my head ATM but I hope to change that. I have been doing some activities on GitCoin and I find a real interest in it. It fascinates me. So, folks! I am here to learn! Teach me all you got, I think I am ready. 
First thing first my README.md Wahla!
